Task 1.

Create a collection of integers and fill it with values entered from the console.
When filling the collection with numbers from the console, you should do type casts.
The code for casting a string to a number can be used as follows:

To finish entering, enter the word "exit".
When casting a string to a number, you should consider the possibility of exceptions.
